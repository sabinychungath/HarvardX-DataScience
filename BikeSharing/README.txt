Intro to Data Science CYO project

For this project, we will be creating a Bike Sharing System using the bike sharing train and test dataset. You will download the data and run code we will provide to generate your datasets.

You will train a machine learning algorithm using the inputs in one subset to predict bike count of both casual and registered users in the validation set. Your project itself will be assessed by peer grading.

Files included: BikeSharing.Rmd includes the downloading and construction of the data sets, the prediction script that develops the model and applies it to the validation list, and the report text and figures. It is self-contained.

BikeSharing.pdf is the final report in PDF format.

BikeSharing.R is A script in R format that generates your predicted bike counts,RMSE and rmsle score.

The remaining files were used in development and testing and are only saved for reference.
